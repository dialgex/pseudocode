# What is pseudocode?

Pseudocode, by definition, is a kind of design format that let's both experienced and beginner programmers express how they want a code to be structured, and therefore executed.

The language simply uses basic english sentence formatting as the core programming structure, so if you know how to read or write in english, you should definitely be able to learn this language.

I will be trying to create converters that translate pseudocode into various different languages.
Some of these languages will be:
* Java
* C++
* Python
* Lua
* And maybe many others

# Is there a language reference?

I'm currently in the process of writing it out, but yes, there will be a language reference.
