# Variables

All variables in Pseudocode are preceded by the $ symbol and cannot contain spaces.  
The language will be able to identify on its own whether a variable is a number or a string.  
However, if it is a mix of letters and numbers, it will default to being a string.

Example:  
'''
$Today is Wednesday
$Tomorrow is Thursday

print $Today
:Wednesday

print $ Tomorrow
:$ Tomorrow
