# Syntax

Many operators typically used by many languages can be used in Pseudocode,  
OR you could use their word counterparts

Example:
'''
"=":  
	Is  
	Is equal to  
	
"==":  
	Matches  
	Equals  
	Is equivalent to  
	
"!":  
	Is not  
	Isn't  
	Does not  
	Doesn't  
	
">":  
	Greater than  
	Is greater than  
	
"<":  
	Less than  
	Is less than  
'''

If the starting word of a line isn't preceded by a symbol, the language assumes it is a function and will try to run it as such.

## Commenting

To comment at the end of a line you use '''--''' before your comment.  
To comment multiple lines, you would begin the comment with '''--[''' and end it with ''']--'''.
